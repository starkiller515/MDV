<p>I have kept my story from Project 2 in this assignment. I also refactored and repurposed much of that code, and actually refactored code from Project 1 here as well. Staying with the zombie theme was very important to me, because it is something I know very well, and it allows me to focus on the code, which is my main problem area.</p>
